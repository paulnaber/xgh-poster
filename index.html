                            As long as you want, XGH will always be on your
                            side. But be careful, don’t abandon it. If you start
                            a system using XGH and abandon it to use a trendy
                            methodology, you’re fucked. XGH does not allow
                            refactoring (see axiom 10), and your new system full
                            of frills will collapse. And at that time, only XGH
                            can save you.

                            That’s a waste of time, especially since refactoring
                            doesn’t exist (see axiom 10). Time is the gear that
                            moves XGH and quality is a negligible detail.

                            Get used to the feeling of imminent failure. Failure
                            and success always go hand in hand, and in XGH it’s
                            no different. People often think that the chances of
                            a project failing using XGH are always greater than
                            it being successful. But
